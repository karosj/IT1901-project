# ScheduleLog
This app is designed to provide an overview of your schoolwork. You add the activities including subject you've been working on, and a brief note about your study session, and how many hours you worked. The app adds a timestamp, date and time, to the activity.

## User Story
I'm wondering how much I actually spend on different subjects during the week to plan next week better. Every time after I've worked on a subject, I go into the app and press the "add" button. Today, I worked on a ITP project. I choose the subject from the dropdown menu and enter 2 hours in the hours field, and some notes. It then appears on top of the list of entries sorted by timestamp when I'm done.
