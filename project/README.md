# ScheduleLog
This app is designed to provide an overview of your schoolwork. You add the subject you've been working on, record the start and end times, and you can write a brief note about your study session, such as how productive you've been. 

## User Story
I'm wondering how much time I actually spend on different subjects during the week to plan next week better. Every time after I've worked on a subject, I go into the app and press the "add" button. I choose the subject from the dropdown menu and enter the number of hours in the field. It then appears in the list of entries sorted by timestamp when I'm done.
