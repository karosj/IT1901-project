# "ScheduleLog" release 1

For this exercise/release, we have reviewed the plan posted on Blackboard.

* The project has been set up and hosted on GitLab. Additionally, we have established a "milestone" and added several "issues" to it. The plan is to resolve all "issues" associated with this "milestone." We have configured the project to actively utilize Maven.

* From a code perspective, we haven't developed anything particularly complex; we have opted for a basic idea. This idea is quite straightforward for now but has the potential for complexity in the future.

* Furthermore, we have created a comprehensive description of the project we intend to develop throughout the course. This description includes explanations, illustrations, and a sort of user story. Regarding "issues," we have assigned them to each member of the group to facilitate task allocation.

* We've also crafted README.md files to describe the projects at the root level, as well as a larger file encompassing the entire project (as mentioned above).

* The design has been developed with simplicity in mind, incorporating a form of data storage. This results in a runnable application, thanks to domain logic, user interface, and architectural layers.
