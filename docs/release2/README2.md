# "ScheduleLog" release 2

For this exercise/release, we have reviewed the plan posted on Blackboard.

- Paragraph related to work habits, workflow, and code quality
    - We mostly work in groups, meeting to discuss strategies, plans, and code together. We review each other's code and 'approve' it on GitLab. All changes are linked to 'issues,' and each 'issue' is assigned its own 'branch' to keep it organized for everyone. This is then linked to a 'Milestone,' which is seen as the goal for a submission. We actively use 'Co-Authored by...' to make collaboration easier. The workflow is good, and every time we encounter a common problem, it is quickly resolved with everyone contributing to the solution.
